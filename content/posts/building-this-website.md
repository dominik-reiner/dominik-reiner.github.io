summary: "An overview of how I built this personal site using Hugo, the PaperMod theme, and some modern integrations."
---

Welcome to my first blog post! Since this is a personal site, it felt only right to start by talking about how this corner of the internet came to be.

When I decided to rebuild my personal site, I wanted something fast, reliable, and easy to maintain. Hugo stood out for its incredible speed and its powerful static site generation capabilities. After looking through many themes, I landed on **PaperMod**. It’s clean, responsive, and has a great "profile mode" that fits what I was looking for.

## Key Features

### 1. The Design
I’m using PaperMod in its "profile mode," which focuses on a minimalist introduction and social links right on the landing page. It’s a perfect way to show who I am and what I do without unnecessary clutter.

### 2. Contact Form with Formspark
Instead of setting up a full backend just for a contact form, I integrated **Formspark**. It provides a simple endpoint for form submissions, making it easy to receive messages while keeping the site static. You can find it on my [Contact](/contact) page.

### 3. Compliance
Operating from Germany means compliance is key, so I’ve ensured the site includes a proper [Imprint](/imprint) and [Data Privacy statement](/privacy) to meet legal requirements.

## What's Next?

This site will be a place for me to share my thoughts on AI engineering and whatever technical projects I'm currently working on. Expect more deep dives into technical challenges and reflections on the building process.

Stay tuned for more!
